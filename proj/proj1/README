# output = my_imfilter(image, filter)
Input
    - image: can be grey or color image with arbitrary number of channels.
    - filter: a 2x2 matrix (kernel), with odd height and width. The height and width need not be the same.

How it work
    the input image is first padded with image reflection so that the output image will be the same size as the input image.
    The image filtering operation is just like the built-in imfilter() in Matlab.

Output
    - output: The output image is filtered by the input filter kernel and is the same size as the input image.
